title: Adoption Readiness
---

Universal React accelerator has taken several steps to ensure the Adoption Readiness of the tool. 

1. Being used by multiple External and few Internal projects. 
2. Tested through various sample applications.
3. Preserves learnings from many successful projects.
4. Has a Passionate  Core Team to support and enhance it. 
5. Detailed documentation site & Video Tutorials from developers who worked upon it. 

## Adoption Strategies 

Universal React accelerator can be adopted into your projects in multiple ways. 

1. **Out of the box adoption**: You can use `npx create-universal-react`to setup your project, if you are completely aligned with [Technology choices](/universal-react-docs/docs/features/). You can make necessary tweaks and adjust these choices post initial setup.
2. **Clone the Generator**: You can clone the generator, customize it as per your organization needs and publish it to artifactory.

## How Universal React team can support adoption. 

1. RFP support.
2. Client pitches.
3. Feature enhancements and customization. 
4. Continuous bug fixes and releases. 
5. Detailed walk through sessions. 

We have a [future road map](/universal-react-docs/docs/road-map/) to continuously evolve this tool and make it even better. 

## How much time you save when using this accelerator?

There are two ways of looking at potential effort saves:

1. It helps you save the most important time at the start of the project, by providing a dependable dev ecosystem. A rough estimate of time saved for off the self (`npx create-universal-react`) implementation is 2 Weeks. Since we have a lot of best practices and optional features baked-in. Owing to its evolving nature, it continues to add value throughout the project life cycle. Therefore actual effort saved is much more.

2. If you are looking to build a similar CLI generator for customized on-prem uses, adopting and publishing this tool into on-prem artifactory can save at least 2 months.
