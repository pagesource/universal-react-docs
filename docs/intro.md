# Universal React

An accelerator for setting-up scalable frontend architecture with Next.js and React.

This accelerator is a command line tool for generating SSR, SSG & Micro-App type of applications. This enables you to setup a working Micro Frontend or SPA development ecosystem with essential tooling for great dev experience and delivery quality.

This will help project teams in building applications with great quality, by giving them more time to focus on business problems rather than web development chores.
