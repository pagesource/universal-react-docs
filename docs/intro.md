# Universal React

An accelerator for setting-up scalable frontend architecture with Next.js and React.

This accelerator is a command line tool for generating SSR, SSG & Micro-App type of applications. This enables you to setup a working Micro Frontend or SPA development ecosystem with essential tooling for great dev experience and delivery quality.
