## Linting

Config packages to unify code linting and typescript configuration and rules across projects. No need to install those packages anymore in your each project and maintain them all separately, thanks to monorepo structure.

## End to End Testing Automation

Use simple JavaScript to write E2E tests and automate functional testing of your application with [TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/).

## Gits Hooks

Linting and Unit testing is configured to run on git commands using [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).
