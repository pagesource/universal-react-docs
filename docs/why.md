## Pain Points of Frontend Development!
1. Reinventing the wheel when setting up new projects. 
2. Maturity and quality of the solution depends on the architect on the project.
3. Delays setting up dev eco-systems, quality gates and pipelines.
4. Overall lack of efficiency, as replication of best practices isnâ€™t easy. 

## How does Universal React addresses above concerns? 
1. Instant initial setup of essential tools for enterprise scale React applications.
