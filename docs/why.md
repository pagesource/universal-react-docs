---

## Pain Points of Frontend Development!
1. Reinventing the wheel when setting up new projects. 
2. Maturity and quality of the solution depends on the architect on the project.
3. Delays setting up dev eco-systems, quality gates and pipelines.
4. Overall lack of efficiency, as replication of best practices isnâ€™t easy. 

## How does Universal React addresses above concerns? 
1. Instant initial setup of essential solutions for enterprise scale React applications. 
2. Continuous value addition beyond initial setup through evolving accelerators.
3. Attention to Developer experience for great productivity.
4. Preservation and replication of low-level best practices. 

With **Reuse, Replicate and Reduce**  philosophy at its core Universal React is an accelerator to generate SSR, SSG or Micro-Apps with essential tooling to enable great dev experience and solution quality.
