## Pain Points of Frontend Development!

1. **Reinventing the wheel** when setting up new projects. 
2. Maturity and quality of the solution depends on the architect on the project.
3. Delays setting up dev eco-systems, quality gates and pipelines.
4. Overall lack of efficiency, as replication of best practices isnâ€™t easy. 

## How does Universal React addresses above concerns? 

1. Enterprise scale React applications needs a lot more focused solutions. 
2. Continuous value addition beyond initial setup through accelerators.
3. Developer experience needs utmost attention for great productivity.
4. Preservation and replication of low-level best practices is a necessity in era of green teams. 

With **Reuse, Replicate and Reduce**  philosophy at its core Universal React is an accelerator to generate SSR, SSG or Micro-Apps with essential tooling to enable great dev experience and solution quality.
