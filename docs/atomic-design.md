Universal React generator has [Atomic Design Philosophy](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) at its core. Apart from setting up Atomic scaffolding structure (Atoms, Molecules, Organism and Template) it brings along customizable npm packages [@xt-pagesource/generate-plop](/universal-react-docs/docs/generate-plop/) to create components, services and hooks on the fly. 

## Implementing Atomic Design

Atomic design is a mental modal, when applied correctly it can do wonders in developing applications with great speed, brings great design consistency and reusability. It pushes you to identify and capture repeatable patterns throughout the application in reusable components. These components in turn will help develop user journeys faster and consistently. Components should be created with [Single Responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-responsibility_principle) in mind to achieve maximum reusability.
